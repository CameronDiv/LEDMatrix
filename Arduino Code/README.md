Here is the main file I used to run the LED Matrix.  I would recommend using this as an example.
The last case statement is an example of how you can use one image but make it appear to be animated to some degree (moving from right to left wrapping around the screen).
The delay is done this specific way in order to keep checking for the button press that will pause the changing images.
